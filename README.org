* Omnifactory Docker Container

This is a simple Minecraft Omnifactory mod pack container that automatically
starts up the container the way Omnifactory should normally start in single
player.

This means you get the default Lost Cities map, the proper oregen, and so on!

Additionally, this container runs as non-root user UID 1234, named minecraft
with a primary group of 1234, also named minecraft. Bear this in mind when
securing its /data volume.

** How to use this

Like any other docker container, with an additional helpful makefile:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ make build
...
$ export EULA=true; make run
#+END_SRC

The container has a separate install process involved when its first run. It
expects the /data volume to be where it will install the server to.

Useful environment variables:

| Variable     | Usage                                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EULA         | Must be set to true or the container won't run. This takes the place of Mojang's eula.txt file. If you set this variable to true, you explicitly agree to Mojang's [[https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula][Minecraft EULA]]. |
| GAMEMODE     | 0 or 1. Defaults to 0. Just like the `/gamemode` command in the game. Determines survival or creative.                                                                             |
| DIFFICULTY   | The difficulty of monsters in the game. Defaults to 0. The usual settings apply here.                                                                                              |
| HARDCORE     | `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`. Determines hardcore mode.                                                                                                                  |
| COMMANDBLOCK | `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`. Determines if command blocks can be used in the map.                                                                                       |
| MAXPLAYERS   | Defaults to 20. The number of players that can be connected at once.                                                                                                               |
| WHITELIST    | `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`. Whether or not to whitelist players.                                                                                                       |
| SEED         | Defaults to nothing, so a random seed can be generated. Set this to genereate a specific map.                                                                                      |
| MOTD         | Defaults to `A Minecraft Server`. The usual MOTD message that shows up in the minecraft multiplayer server list.                                                                   |
| RCONPASS     | Defaults to nothing, so RCON won't be enabled by default. Set this to give RCON a password and enable RCON.                                                                        |

On start, the container will update your installation using the latest version
of the files it has in the container, update permissions, optionally create a
server.properties file if there isn't one, and then start the server.
